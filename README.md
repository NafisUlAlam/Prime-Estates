# Purpose

- In this website, users can register using their email and password, also they can use their google credentials for seamless login experience. There are three roles (Admin, Buyers and Sellers). Admin can manage properties (verify, delete), manage users etc. Buyers can add any property to their wishlist and bid their prices. They can also post reviews on properties. Sellers can add properties which need to be verified by the admins first and then they can be sold. Sellers can also update the properties. If a bid is successful, the buyer can pay through Stripe and buy the property.
